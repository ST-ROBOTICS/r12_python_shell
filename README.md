# r12_python_shell
A Python package providing a low-level interface for the ST Robotics R12
robotic arm. Updated from Adam Heins' shell. This is not a ROS package; it is a shell for sending sending ROBOFORTH commands to the r12 arm externally from ROS, while running in a linux system.

## Shell
The `r12-shell` executable is automatically installed with the package. It
provides a shell interface to the robot arm for testing.

## Manuals
See the ST Robotics manuals on the R12 arm and ROBOFORTH for more information.
